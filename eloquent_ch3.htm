        // Function binding

        // MDN says The bind() method creates a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.


        // Closure = Being able to reference a specific instance of a local binding in an enclosed scope.

        // What happens to local bindings when the function call that created them is no longer active?

        // The following code shows an example of this. It defines a function, wrapValue, that creates a local binding. It then returns a function that accesses and returns this local binding.

        function wrapValue(n) {
            let local = n; // You don't need to say this because n is already local

        // Recursion = You knew we were getting to this.
        // A function that calls itself is recursive. 
        function pow(base, exponent) {
            if (exponent == 0) {
                return 1;

        // → 8

        // Running through this function is more mathematical but less efficient than looping multiple times, so programmers usually opt for what's easier to understand. 

        // A lot of times, problems that require branching can be best solved with recursion. 

        //         Consider this puzzle: by starting from the number 1 and repeatedly either adding 5 or multiplying by 3, an infinite set of numbers can be produced. How would you write a function that, given a number, tries to find a sequence of such additions and multiplications that produces that number?

        // For example, the number 13 could be reached by first multiplying by 3 and then adding 5 twice, whereas the number 15 cannot be reached at all.

        // Here is a recursive solution:

        function findSolution(target) {
            function find(current, history) { // find() takes the current number and 
                // a string that tracks how we reached it. It returns null if it doesn't find a solution. Otherwise, it shows how to get the number.
                if (current == target) {
                    return history; // the current number is the target
                } else if (current > target) {
                    return null; // there's no point in adding to the number
                } else {
                    return find(current + 5, `(${history} + 5)`) ||
                        find(current * 3, `(${history} * 3)`);
                }
            }
            return find(1, "1");
        }

        console.log(findSolution(24));
        // → (((1 * 3) + 5) * 3)
